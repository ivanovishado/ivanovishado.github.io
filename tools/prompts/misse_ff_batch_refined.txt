A high-fidelity screenshot of a dark, cinematic and minimalist "FLIGHT LOGS" section from a premium portfolio website. 16:9 aspect ratio, 1024x576 resolution. Shot on a 35mm anamorphic lens, sharp focus on UI elements. DESIGN SYSTEM "EVENT HORIZON": Background is deep warm charcoal void (#030305) with clear, crisp star dust particles (no nebulas/clouds). Primary accent is Indigo (#6366F1) for structural elements. Active signal is Cyan (#00F0FF) for interactive states. LAYOUT - DUAL-SLOT INTERFACE: Header bar at top reads "> FLIGHT LOGS: SELECT MISSION ARCHIVE" in monospace, flanked by thin horizontal scanlines. Two mission tabs below: "[ 01: MISSE-FF (DEPLOYED) ]" (active, glowing indigo underline with downward arrow) and "[ 02: SAMARA-CS (TRAINING) ]" (inactive, dimmed). LEFT SLOT - EXPANDED DATA PANEL: A large, prominent frosted aerogel glass card with 2px rounded corners, subtle indigo inner glow, 15% transparency. HEADER is "PROJECT: MISSE-FF / CRS-31 FLIGHT" in large Cabinet Grotesk variable font (bold). CONTENT in monospace: STATUS: RETURNED TO EARTH, DURATION: 6 MONTHS IN ORBIT, MISSION: "Surviving the Vacuum", ARTIFACT: Material Specimen Container, MEDIA_UPLINK with [ READ: FORBES ] and [ READ: EL PAIS ] buttons. NO "DATA READOUT PANEL" label below. RIGHT SLOT - 3D ARTIFACT SHOWCASE: A dedicated open space for the 3D rotating artifact. BACKGROUND is clean empty void with starfield. NO volumetric clouds/fog. NO cyberpunk circuit lines/details behind panels. ARTIFACT is a translucent ghost-like metallic container floating in the void. NO "3D ARTIFACT ZONE" label below. FOOTER: Clean empty space at bottom. NO status/telemetry bar. LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE: Clean, studio-like darkness. NO lens flares or lighting effects stemming from borders. Soft localized glow from UI elements only. Sharp, crisp UI edges. AESTHETIC: Maximalist information in a Minimalist void. High-end sci-fi data terminal. Clean, readable, distraction-free.
