A high-contrast, holographic tactical mission map background (1:1 aspect ratio). Designed to sit behind a dark 3D satellite model. VISUAL DATA: Subject: A stylized world map focusing on the flight trajectory: Mexico City (MEX) -> Barcelona (BCN) -> Dubai (DXB) -> Samara (KUF). Trajectory: A bright, glowing CYAN (#00F0FF) arc connecting these points. The line should be the brightest element. Nodes: Bright white pulse dots at each city location. Map Style: Faint, digital wireframe continents. Dark charcoal/indigo background (#101018) - slightly lighter than total void to provide silhouette contrast for a black-body satellite. Atmosphere: Subtle "screen glow" or "holographic interference" texture. Telemetry: Faint grid lines and lat/long coordinates in background. CONTRAST STRATEGY: The user's satellite is dark (black/dark blue). Therefore, this background map features bright, luminous vector lines and a soft ambient backlight (volumetric glow) near the center to ensure the dark foreground object stands out. AESTHETIC: Sci-fi Mission Control. "WarGames" meets "SpaceX Interface". Clean, vector-like, sharp. No clouds, no realistic terrain. Pure data visualization.
