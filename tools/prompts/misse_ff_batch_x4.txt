A high-fidelity screenshot of a dark, cinematic "FLIGHT LOGS" section from a premium portfolio website. 16:9 aspect ratio, 1920x1080 resolution. Shot on a 35mm anamorphic lens with subtle lens flares and chromatic aberration at edges. DESIGN SYSTEM "EVENT HORIZON": Background is deep warm charcoal void (#030305) with subtle drifting star dust particles. Primary accent is Indigo (#6366F1) for structural elements. Active signal is Cyan (#00F0FF) for interactive states. Text is Starlight silver (#E2E8F0) in JetBrains Mono for data, Cabinet Grotesk for headers. LAYOUT - DUAL-SLOT INTERFACE: Header bar at top reads "> FLIGHT LOGS: SELECT MISSION ARCHIVE" in monospace, flanked by thin horizontal scanlines. Two mission tabs below: "[ 01: MISSE-FF (DEPLOYED) ]" (active, glowing indigo underline with downward arrow) and "[ 02: SAMARA-CS (TRAINING) ]" (inactive, dimmed). LEFT SLOT - DATA READOUT PANEL: A frosted aerogel glass card with 2px rounded corners, subtle indigo inner glow, 15% transparency. Contains mission telemetry: PROJECT: MISSE-FF / CRS-31 FLIGHT, STATUS: RETURNED TO EARTH, DURATION: 6 MONTHS IN ORBIT, MISSION: "Surviving the Vacuum", ARTIFACT: Material Specimen Container, MEDIA_UPLINK with [ READ: FORBES ] and [ READ: EL PAIS ] buttons with magnetic hover glow. RIGHT SLOT - 3D ARTIFACT ZONE: Large dark space for 3D rotating artifact, showing only subtle placeholder glow/silhouette. Background shows faint HDRI reflection of Earth, volumetric fog drifting slowly, cyan rim lighting from upper right, star field visible through transparency. FOOTER: Thin status bar reading "SYSTEM: NOMINAL | TELEMETRY: ACTIVE" in small monospace. MATERIALS & LIGHTING: UI cards are frosted glass with subsurface scattering. Borders have chrome finish with fresnel reflections. Three-point cinematic lighting with cool white key, soft indigo ambient fill, sharp cyan rim light. Volumetric light shafts cutting diagonally. Scanline texture overlay at 5% opacity. AESTHETIC: Future-Industrial. Linear meets Interstellar. NASA mission control meets luxury car dashboard. Awwwards-featured quality. Premium, tactile, weightless.
