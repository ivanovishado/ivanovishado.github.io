#### 2. Add Featured Projects Section
- [ ] Create 2-3 project deep dives with:
  - Hero image or diagram
  - Problem statement
  - Your role and tech stack
  - Quantifiable outcomes (e.g., "Processed 2B events/month", "Reduced latency by 40%")
- [ ] Link to live demos, GitHub repos, or press coverage where applicable

#### 3. Hero Section Enhancement
- [x] Add a signature motion design moment (animated gradient, subtle mesh, geometric shapes)
- [x] Make your name *dominate* — larger, more dramatic
- [x] Consider a rotating tagline: "Building at Scale • Shipping Impact • Mentoring Others"
- [ ] Add cursor-tracking glow effect on desktop

## 🚫 Explicitly Deprioritized

- ~~Storytelling/narrative arc~~ — Keeping this as a resume-to-web format
- ~~Bilingual content~~ — Not needed for now
- ~~Moving off Tailwind CDN~~ — Current approach is fine
- ~~Loading/lazy optimization~~ — Not a priority currently
